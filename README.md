  ## Description
  This book search engine allows you to type in a keyword that will then produce a list of books with details such as title, description, authors. If you make an account, you can save books and create a list of your faves. 
  
  Using starter code, I converted the working RESTful API version of this app into a GraphQL API, making it more succinct and easier to scale.
